# Layer 2 Scaling Survey
## What is Layer 2 scaling?

In the 7 layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model regarding communication functions of a computing system, Layer 1 refers to the physical layer and Layer 2 to the data link layer. Layer 1 is never concerned with functions delivered by Layer 2 and up, it just delivers transmission and reception of raw data. In turn Layer 2 only knows about Layer 1 and defines the protocols that deliver node-to-node data transfer. [1]

In the block chain and cryptocurrency world, transaction processing scaling is a tough problem to solve. This is limited by the average block creation time, the block size limit and number of newer blocks needed to confirm a transaction (confirmation time). These factors make '*over the counter*' type transactions nearly impossible if done on the main block chain (on-chain).

Decentralised Layer 2 protocols, also commonly referred to as Layer 2 scaling, refers to transaction throughput scaling solutions that run on top of the main block chain (off-chain), while preserving the attributes of the main block chain. Instead of each transactions only the resultant of a number of transactions will be embedded on-chain. [2]

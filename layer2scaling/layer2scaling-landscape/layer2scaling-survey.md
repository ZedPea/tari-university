# Layer 2 Scaling Survey
## What is Layer 2 scaling?

In the block chain and cryptocurrency world, transaction processing scaling is a tough problem to solve. This is limited by the average block creation time, the block size limit and number of newer blocks needed to confirm a transaction (confirmation time). These factors make '*over the counter*' type transactions nearly impossible if done on the main block chain (on-chain).

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model defines 7 layers for communication functions of a computing system. Layer 1 refers to the physical layer and Layer 2 to the data link layer. Layer 1 is never concerned with functions of Layer 2 and up, it just delivers transmission and reception of raw data. In turn Layer 2 only knows about Layer 1 and defines the protocols that deliver node-to-node data transfer. [1]

Analogous to the OSI layers for communication, in block chain technology decentralised Layer 2 protocols, also commonly referred to as Layer 2 scaling, refers to transaction throughput scaling solutions. Decentralised Layer 2 protocols run on top of the main block chain (off-chain), while preserving the attributes of the main block chain. Instead of each transaction only the resultant of a number of transactions will be embedded on-chain. [2]

### #3 State Channels

#### What is it?

State channels allow multiple transactions to be made within off-chain agreements with very fast processing and the final settlement on-chain. It keeps the operation mode of block chain protocol but changes the way it is used so as to deal with the challenge of scalability.

Trinity is an open-source network protocol  



#### Who does it?

NEO (via Trinity). Trinity is an open-source network protocol based on NEP-5 smart contracts.

NEO sees Trinity as their answer to Bitcoin's Lightning Network in order to achieve real-time payments, low transaction fees, scalability, micro transactions, and privacy protection for all NEO (NEP-5) assets. [3]

# Layer 2 Scaling Survey
## What is layer 2 scaling?

In the 7 layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model regarding communication functions of a computing system, layer 1 refers to the physical layer and layer 2 to the data link layer. Layer 1 is never concerned with functions delivered by layer 2 and up, it just delivers transmission and reception of raw data. Layer 2 knows about layer 1 and defines the protocols that deliver node-to-node data transfer. [1]

In the block chain and cryptocurrency world transaction processing scaling is a tough problem to solve. This is limited by the average block creation time, the block size limit and blocks deep needed to confirm a transaction (or confirmation time). These factors make 'over the counter' type transactions nearly impossible if done on the main block chain (on-chain).

Layer 2 scaling refers to transaction throughput scaling solutions that can happen off the main block chain (off-chain), but still be linked to and with the resultant transactions embedded on-chain.
